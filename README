There are two projects here, the Proteus language engine (core) and the Slipstream program which uses Proteus (slyp).

In ./core, run 

cd core
cmake .

No need to run cmake again. To builf and run just do:

make
./clip

clip is the CLI.

This will also make ptest which is used to test the build. To test the build see the file ./core/README_TO_TEST_BUILDS.

------
To run the Slipstream engine 

cd slyp
make
./slyp
