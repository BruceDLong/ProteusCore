README_TO_TEST_BUILDS:
======================

A smallish system called NOSE is being used to execute tests written in python.

After you install NOSE you can execute the tests by running:

$nosetests test_build.py

Even easier: The script M does a 'make' then executes the tests.

Look at test_build.py to see how to add your own tests.

INSTALLING NOSE:
===================

1. INSTALL pexpect 

The file pexpect-2.3.tar.gz is in the project/core folder, but you can also read how to fetch and install it here: http://www.noah.org/wiki/Pexpect#Download_and_Installation

$cd pexpect-2.3/
$sudo python ./setup.py install
